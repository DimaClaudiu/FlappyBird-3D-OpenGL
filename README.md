A simple 2D illusion can be achived using orthographic projection, giving the game a more familiar feel.

With the debug mode enabled, the collision checking is visible, each dot representing the center of a circle. A couple of those overlapping gives us a nice approximation of the pipes geometry. 

Plus, only one pair of pipes can be collided with at any given time, so we'll check only those. This makes for a verry efficient collision detection.

## Usage
  `Space` for starting the game and jumping, `1` to enable debug mode, `2` turns the ortogtaphic projection on for the 2D effect, and `3` turns back the perspective view for a normal 3D experience.

## Completion Date
2019, October 26
